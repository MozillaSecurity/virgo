## What is Virgo?

[Virgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_Supercluster) aims to be a concept for creating a cluster of fuzzers made by people who are willing to trade and contribute IDLE times of their workstations to a greater good.

## How does it work?

Virgo's infrastructure is based on Docker containers. Virgo fetches routinely a remote server for new tasks by downloading a `Task Definition File`. This file contains information in how to run a certain Docker image and what host preferences are required. If the hosts preferences met the criterias for a certain task, Virgo will download the Docker image, create a container and run that container until the user either pauses or stops that task manually or by having a sheduler setup to automate this routine.

## Why should I participate?

Virgo can theoretically be used for any arbitrary work task defined in a container. However, Virgo was built as a fuzzing solution in mind. The more people participate, the faster and more intesively we can test a particular feature in our products. Besides that, you can earn a bounty once your task discovered a security issue. If multiple users found the same issue, the bounty will be shared across the pool of finders.

## Developer Usage

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/mozillasecurity/virgo <project-name>
cd <project-name>
npm install --silent
```

### Task Definition Server

```
json-server -p 8081 --watch tasks.json
```

You have now successfully checked-out Virgo. To run the development version use `npm start` and to produce a production build run first `npm run build` and optionally `npm run release <platform>`. Where `platform` can be `macos64`, `windows64`, `linux64` or `''` to create a release for all platforms.

> Developer extensions are enabled in non-production builds, except Devtron for analyzing IPC traffic. You can enable it by entering `require('devtron').install()` in the Developer Console.

## Commands

For a detailed list of commands run `npm run`
