## What is Virgo?

Virgo aims to be a concept for creating a cluster of fuzzers made by people who are willing to trade and contribute IDLE times of their workstations to a greater good.

## How does it work?

Virgo's infrastructure is based on Docker containers. Virgo fetches routinely a remote server for new tasks by downloading a `Task Definition File`. This file contains information in how to run a certain Docker image and what host preferences are required. If the hosts preferences met the criterias for a certain task, Virgo will download the Docker image, create a container and run that container until the user either pauses or stops that task manually or by having a sheduler setup to automate this routine.

## Why should I participate?

Virgo can theoretically be used for any arbitrary work task defined in a container. However, Virgo was built as a fuzzing solution in mind. The more people participate, the faster and more intesively we can test a particular feature in our products. Besides that, you can earn a bounty once your task discovered a security issue. If multiple users found the same issue, the bounty will be shared across the pool of finders.

## Developer Usage

The project recommends `yarn`. If you have not installed `yarn` follow the individual platform instructions [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). For MacOS it is as easy as running `brew install yarn`.

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/mozillasecurity/virgo <project-name>
cd <project-name>
yarn install
```

You have now successfully checked-out Virgo. To run the development version use `yarn start` and to produce a production build run `yarn dist`.

## Commands

For a detailed list of commands take a look into the `scripts` section of `package.json`.
